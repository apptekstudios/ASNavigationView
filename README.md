# ASNavigationView

A SwiftUI library to aid navigation (and work around existing swiftUI bugs)


## Usage
This is a work-in-progress. It aims to work around SwiftUI navigation bugs introdued in iOS 13.2

- Use `ASNavigationView` in place of `NavigationView`
- Use `ASNavigationButton` in place of `NavigationButton`
- If you want a view to act as a layer (be returned to when the child is dismissed), wrap it in `ASNavigationLayer`
